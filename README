Curve parameters
----------------

The curve parameters are copied from bouncycastle's java implementation.

handy regexps to run the raw strings through (in vim) are:
s/\([a-z0-9]\{2\}\)/, 0x\1/g
followed by:
s/0x\([8-9,a-f]\)/(byte)0x\1/g

Usage
-----

After the applet is loaded there exists two instructions for each curve.
X1 for generate and X2 for sign, where the generate instruction takes no
parameters and sends out the public key as response and the sign instruction
takes the data to be signed as data.
X in the instruction corresponds to the curve:

* 0 = brainpoolp256r1
* 1 = secp256r1
* 2 = brainpoolp320r1
* 3 = brainpoolp256t1
* 4 = secp256k1
* 5 = gost2001
* 6 = frp256v1
